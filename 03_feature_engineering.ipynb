copyright act dmcatake action here eff for membership information see alert bait and switch anticounterfeiting bill hurts your rightsdont be fooled by senator bidens anticounterfeiting amendments of 2002 s 2395 also known as the biden bill it started as an attempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and counterfeiting money but its scope has been greatly expanded to include digital watermarks on copyrighted material this is a sneaky powergrab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in copyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners it goes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could prevent universities libraries and consumers from enjoying the exceptions to the copyright act adopted by congress s 2935 could prohibit the use of interface information essential for software interoperability and competition impose new responsibilities on internet service providers and could also require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to reconfigure their products impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by the copyright act for identical behaviorthis anticounterfeiting bill is a decoy stand up for your rights today subscribe to the eff action center and send your member of congress an email letter or fax you can take action by going to eff for membership information see canadian trademark law overreachingeff has been involved in several cases involving overreaching trademark claims on the internet recently we have learned about a canadian lawsuit over the website wwwlawsnetcom a nonprofit legal information website focusing on the laws of canada and china that seem especially egregiouslawsnetcom is a free legal information website that has been published since 1998 last year lawsnetcoms owner ling xia was sued by quicklaw a subsidiary of global publishing giant lexisnexus group quicklaw claims that lawsnetcom violates its rights in the name lawnet however lawnet does not have a public internet website under that domain name the name appears on a subsidiary webpage of the quicklawcom website that offers public teasers in the form of summaries of recent canadian cases with the full text only available through the private proprietary paid quicklaw service for canadian lawyers it seems clear that the two names are substantially different are used in different places one as a teaser for a closed computer service and the other for information freely available on the public internet and are not causing any consumer confusion even more problematic quicklaw does not even have a canadian trademark in the term lawnet it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed requests for extensions of time with the canadian trademark authorities in contrast ms xia is in the final stages of having a canadian trademark issued for lawsnetregardless of its weak case quicklaw has managed to drag ms xia through over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a court order requiring her to undergo an extensive discovery process that threatens to drive her under although she has had some free legal assistance in the past this next phase will require significantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can muster quicklaw is represented by a large toronto firm borden ladner and gervais llpabuse of trademark law even here when no official trademark has even been granted is a growing problem on the internet and it is unfortunately becoming an international problem eff urges quicklaw and its usbased parent company to stop beating up on this free and useful website while trademark law is important when misuse of a mark is causing consumer confusion it does not and should not grant ownership in words especially descriptive words like laws and net when describing an online legal information service trademark law should also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal information or any other nonproprietary information to stop individuals who want to use the power of the internet to provide free legal information to the publicfor those who wish to help ms xia directly local toronto lawyer
